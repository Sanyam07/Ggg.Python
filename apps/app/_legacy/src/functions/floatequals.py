from math import fabs
# equals(a, b, tolerance)
# Returns true if a = b or |a - b| < tolerance.
# If a and b differ by only a small amount
# (specified by tolerance), a and b are considered
# "equal." Useful to account for floating-point
# round-off error.
# The == operator is checked first since some special
# floating-point values such as floating-point infinity
# require an exact equality check.
