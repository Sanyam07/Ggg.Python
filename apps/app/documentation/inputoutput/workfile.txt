The POLE data model - Person, Object, Location, Event - is commonly applied to security and investigative use cases such as policing, anti-terrorism, border control, and social services. Itâ€™s also a great fit for the graph and graph algorithms. Join us for a demonstration of how Neo4j, graph algorithms, and the POLE data model can support police and social services investigations and generate real-time insights using the Neo4j browser as well as some sample Tableau visualisations
